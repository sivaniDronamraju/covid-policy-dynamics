# COVID-19 Policy Dynamics

State-level analysis of how COVID-19 policy strictness and vaccination uptake evolved alongside case and mortality outcomes in the United States.

## What this project is
A descriptive, comparative analysis focused on interpretability and scope control when working with observational public health and policy data.

## What this project is not
- Not a causal evaluation of policy effectiveness
- Not a forecasting or predictive model
- Not a comprehensive epidemiological study

## Key takeaways
- Outcome trajectories across large states diverged early and did not reconverge
- Higher vaccination coverage does not imply lower cumulative case burden
- Timing, early exposure, and population scale dominate aggregate outcomes

## Data
COVID-19 Data Hub accessed via the `COVID19` R package.

## Methods
R, tidyverse, time-series visualization, population-normalized comparisons.

## Notes on interpretation
All findings are descriptive. Observed alignments between policy measures, vaccination uptake, and outcomes reflect co-evolution over time rather than isolated effects.
